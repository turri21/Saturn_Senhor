-=(Saturn_Senhor notes)=-

Tested: Working Video 720p, 1080p & Sound

Important: Senhor does not support Dual SDRAM (at least for now).

Dev notes: Synthesize ST-V and Saturn in a separate folder or use the clean.bat after synthesizing each one. They share common files and that has side effects on the synthesized binaries.
